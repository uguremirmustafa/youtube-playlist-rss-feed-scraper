# youtube-playlist-rss-feed-scraper
A small script to scrape youtube playlist rss feeds of a youtube channel.

---
I personally hate using browser for watching youtube, and especially youtube addvertisement algorithm. That's why I have been using a command line tool called Newsboat as a 
rss feed reader. With that program you can pull youtube playlists from cli. But finding playlist ID's for each channel gets a little messy if you try to find hundreds of channels. 
This small script is the solution for that issue. 

Step 1: Run the script with 'node playlistScraper'
--
Step 2: Go to your favourite youtube channel's playlists tab. 
--
Step 3: Grab the link and paste to the program
--
Result: Your playlist rss feed links will be in the same directory of the script.
